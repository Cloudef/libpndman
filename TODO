change how remote repositories are saved (change every repository as seperate json file, instead stitched together)
compress database json files
show time and speed in milkyhelper
check archived PNDs md5sums, if local md5 hits one of them, it's older than on repo
make the structs saner (remove statically allocated crap), currently they take quite a lot of memory
